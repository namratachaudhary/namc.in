Hello good people.

I usually send out a box of assorted home-made butter cookies to friends and family, but this year I am hoping to send it out to some good people here. 
They're nice hand-crafted boxes and the cookies are made in a nice, clean kitchen with fresh organically sourced ingredients. I'm hoping to send out about 20-25 boxes depending on how the sign-ups go.

### Cookies -
* Made of locally sourced ingredients, mostly organic
* Gluten-free options available (peanut cookies, almond cookies)
* I suppose butter comprises as dairy - so no dairy-free option, but peanut cookies can be made that way.
* These are not big-cakey cookies, but rather small, crumbly butter cookies.
* Ideally I would prefer it to be one-box per household, but if I am left with extras, they can be given away on first-come-first-serve basis.

### Payments -
* The cookie-box itself is free, but should you feel like contributing to the cost of ingredients, [**you can use this link**](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/namc)
  * In order to keep the running costs transparent, we are going to try and keep a running spreadsheet of the costs incurred in the process - this will be publicly available.
  * Should you choose not to contribute, it wont be held against you. You get the same cookie box with equal love, regardless ‚ù§Ô∏è
* If you are choosing to get the box delivered, it would be preferred if you could cover the postage.
* I will not be able to hand-deliver the box anywhere outside of Dublin 4, however postal would be okay!

### FAQS -
* What is the last day for sign-up? **15 November, 2021**
* Can I send it to my mam in Canada? Sadly, no. This is **Ireland-only**
* Can I share it with my friends? Yes, that would be nice. But Ireland-only.
* What is the shelf-life of the cookies? They last up to **4 weeks at room temperature**, but I'm 100% sure they will be gone within less than a week üòã
* When will the box be shipped/ready for collection? Depending on signups, I am aiming for **shipping within first/second week of December**
* Are there more people involved? Unfortunately (or fortunately?) no, its a one-woman shop and I have a lot of support from my partner, **Stephen** ‚ù§Ô∏è
* Is this a business in making? **Absolutely not**. Its an opportunity for me to share my love for baking with people I love. This is not a retirement-plan or a business opportunity.

Looking forward to sending you cookies!
