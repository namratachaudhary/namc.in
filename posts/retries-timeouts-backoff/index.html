All clients/drivers that help connect your service to an external server has a Timeout parameter, which often defaults to zero, or -1. This means that the timeout is undefined, or infinite.</p><p>eg - See the <code>connectTimeout</code> and <code>socketTimeout</code> definition <a href=https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-j/5.1/en/connector-j-reference-configuration-properties.html>Mysql Connector Configuration</a></p><p>Most requests to external servers should have a timeout attached. This is essential when the server is not responding in a timely manner. If this value is not set, and defaults to 0/-1 , your code may hang for minutes or even more. This happens because when you do not receive a response from application server and since your timeout is indefinite, or infintely large, the connection pool remains open. As more requests come in, more connections open up which consequently never close, thereby causing your connection pool to run out. This causes a cascading failure in your application.</p><p>So whenever you are configuring your application to use such connectors, please set an explicit timeout value in their configurations.</p><p>One must also implement timeouts on both, frontend and backend. That is, if a read/write operation is stuck on a rest api or socket for too long, an exception should be raised and connection should be broken. This should signal the backend to cancel the operation and close the connection, thereby preventing indefinitely open connections.</p><h2 id=retries>Retries<a href=#retries class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h2><p>We might need to understand a little about <strong>transient failures</strong> as we would be using that term frequently.
Simply put, transient failures in your service are temporary glitches, e.g. a network congestion, database overload. Something which is perhaps correct itself given enough cool-off period.</p><p><strong>How to determine if a failure is transient?</strong></p><p>The answer lies in implementation detail of your API/Server responses. If you have a rest API, return a <a href=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.6.1>503 Service Unavailable</a> instead of other 5xx/4xx error messages. This will let the client know that the timeout is being caused by &ldquo;a temporary overload&rdquo; - not because of a code-level error.</p><p>Retries, although helpful, are a bit notorious if not configured properly. Here&rsquo;s how you can figure out the correct way to use retries.</p><p><strong>Retry</strong></p><p>If the error received from the server is transient, e.g. a network packet got currupted while being transmitted, the application could retry the request immediately because the failure is unlike to happen again.</p><p>This is however very agressive, and could prove to be detrimental to your service, which might already be running at capacity, or unavailable completely. It also degrades the application response time as your service would be trying to perform a failing operation continuously.</p><p>If your business logic requires this retry policy, it is best to limit the number of retries to prevent further requests going to the same source.</p><p><strong>Retry after delay</strong></p><p>If the fault is caused due to connectivity failures or due to excess traffic on the network, the application should add a delay period as per business logic before retrying the requests.</p><div class=highlight><pre style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-java data-lang=java><span style=color:#66d9ef>for</span><span style=color:#f92672>(</span><span style=color:#66d9ef>int</span> attempts <span style=color:#f92672>=</span> 0<span style=color:#f92672>;</span> attempts <span style=color:#f92672>&lt;</span> 5<span style=color:#f92672>;</span> attempts<span style=color:#f92672>+</span><span style=color:#f92672>+</span><span style=color:#f92672>)</span>

</code></pre></div><p>When using a library that connects to external services, please check if it implements retry policies, allowing you to configure maximum number of retries, delay between retries etc.</p><p>You can also implement retry policy on server-side, by setting a <a href=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-7.1.3>Retry-After</a> in response header.</p><p>It is also important to log why the operation might be failing. Some times it is due to lack of resources which can handled by adding more instances of that service. Other times it could be due to a memory leak, or a null-pointer exceptions. Hence, it is imperative to add logs and track the performance of your application.</p><h2 id=backoffs>Backoffs<a href=#backoffs class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h2><p>As we saw above, we can add delay to the retry policy. This delay is often referred to as <em>linear backoff</em>. This approach may not be the best way to implement a retry policy.</p><p>Consider the case where the fault in your service could be happening because the database is overloaded. It is quite possible that after some retries our request might succeed. It is also possible that consequent requests might be <strong>adding to the overload</strong> of your database server.Thus, the service would be in overloaded state far longer and will take more time to recover from this state.</p><p>There are several strategies that can be used to solve this problem.</p><p><strong>1. <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_backoff>Exponential Backoff</a></strong></p><p>As the name suggests. instead of period delay of, say 5 seconds, between retries, increase the delay between requests exponentially. We do this till we reach the maximum retry limit. If the request continues to fail, let the client know that the request has failed.</p><p>You must also set a limit on how large the delay can be. Exponential backoff might result in setting a delay which is very large, thereby keeping the request socket open indefinitely, and making the thread sleep for &ldquo;eternity&rdquo;. This will drain the system resources, thereby causing more problems with connection pools.</p><div class=highlight><pre style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-java data-lang=java><span style=color:#66d9ef>int</span> delay <span style=color:#f92672>=</span> 50

</code></pre></div><p>One major drawback of exponential backoff is seen in distributed systems, where <strong>requests that backoff at the same time, also retry at the same time</strong>. This causes clusters of calls. Therefore, instead of reducing number of clients competing in every round, we have now introduced periods when no client is competing. A fixed progression exponential backoff does not reduce the contention much, and generates <strong>peaks of loads</strong>.</p><p><strong>2. <a href=https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/exponential-backoff-and-jitter/>Backoff with jitter</a></strong></p><p>In order to deal with load of spikes as mentioned in exponential backoff, we add <em>jitter</em> to our backoff strategy. Jitter is a decorrelation strategy, it adds randomness to retry intervals and spreads out the load. This avoids cluster of network calls.</p><p>Jitter is usually not part of any configuration property and needs to implemented by the client. All it only requires is a function which can add randomness, and dynamically calculate the duration to wait before retrying.</p><p>By introducing jitter, the initial group of failing requests may be clustered in a very small window, say 100ms, but with each retry cycle, the cluster of requests spreads into a larger and larger time window, thereby reducing the size of the spike at a given time. The service is likely to be able to handle the requests when spread over a sufficiently large window.</p><div class=highlight><pre style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-java data-lang=java><span style=color:#66d9ef>int</span> delay <span style=color:#f92672>=</span> 50

This could be due to a connectivity failure, power outtage (yes, they are very real) etc. The client would end up retrying several times, wasting system resources, further leading to cascading failures across multiple systems.</p><p>So we need a mechanism to determine if the failure is long-lasting, and implement a solution to handle it.</p><p><strong>3. <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_breaker_design_pattern>Circuit Breakers</a></strong></p><p>Circuit Breaker pattern is useful for handling long-lasting transient failures of a service by determining its availability, preventing the client from retrying requests that are bound to fail.</p><p>Circuit breaker design pattern requires that the state of the connection be retained over a series of requests.

If it succeeds, the circuit resets to <strong>closed</strong> state, else it is set as <strong>open</strong> again.</p><p>This helps in avoiding cluster of retry executions during long lasting faults, saving system resources.</p><p>While this can be maintained locally in a state variable, you might need an external storage layer if you have a <strong>distributed system</strong>. In a multi-node setup, the state of application server will need to shared across all instances. In such a scenario, you can use Redis, memcached to keep a record of the availability of external services. Before making any requests to external service, the state of service is queried from the persistent storage.</p><h2 id=idempotency-in-distributed-systems>Idempotency in distributed systems<a href=#idempotency-in-distributed-systems class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h2><p>A service is idempotent when clients can make same requests repeatedly while producing same end-result.
