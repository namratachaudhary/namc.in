I usually send out a box of assorted home-made butter cookies to friends and family, but this year I am hoping to send it out to some good people here. They&amp;rsquo;re nice hand-crafted boxes and the cookies are made in a nice, clean kitchen with fresh organically sourced ingredients. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to send out about 20-25 boxes depending on how the sign-ups go.
Cookies - Made of locally sourced ingredients, mostly organic Gluten-free options available (peanut cookies, almond cookies) I suppose butter comprises as dairy - so no dairy-free option, but peanut cookies can be made that way.</description></item></channel></rss>
