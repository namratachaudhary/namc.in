Prometheus to scrape data from K8S resources
A good practice would be to use observable containers (application containers that push metrics to an endpoint). A lot can be automated with CR auto discovery from the Prometheus Operator.</description></item><item><title>Understanding Observability (and the family) in Cloud Infrastructure</title><link>/posts/cloud-observability/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 May 2020 16:25:12 +0200</pubDate><guid>/posts/cloud-observability/</guid><description>This blog post is divided in two parts -
[Understanding the terminlogogies in Observability Ecosystem and corresponding tools](Terminologies in Observability Ecosystem) How you can use some bare-minimum tooling to improve observability in your kubernetes cluster Terminologies in Observability Ecosystem With a huge shift towards Kubernetes and therefore, a distributed systems service architecture, we see a constant need to have solid observability practices. This ranges from application-level monitoring to OS &amp;amp; Network monitoring, as well as capturing telemetry and kubernetes events.</description></item></channel></rss>
