While we learn a lot about making highly available systems, we often overlook resiliency in system design.
Sure we have heard about fault-tolerant, but what is “resilience” now? Personally, I like to define it a system’s ability to handle and eventually recover from unexpected conditions. There are several ways to go about making your systems resilient to failure, but in this post, we will focus on following</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/posts/retries-timeouts-backoff/>Read more →</a></div></div><div class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=/posts/ssh-port-forwarding/>SSH Tunneling - Local, Remote & Dynamic</a></h1><div class=post-meta><span class=post-date>June 26, 2018</span></div><span class=post-tags>#<a href=/tags/networking/>Networking</a>&nbsp;</span><div class=post-content>Most of us are familiar with SSH (Secure Shell) - a protocol which allows us to securely log onto remote systems. SSH Tunneling (also known as SSH Port Forwarding) is a feature of SSH which forwards encrypted connections between a local and remote system. SSH tunneling works by using the already established SSH connection for sending additional network traffic.
We’re going to look at the three types of port forwarding - local, remote & dynamic.</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/posts/ssh-port-forwarding/>Read more →</a></div></div><div class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=/posts/lenses-part-1/>Haskell Lens - Part 1</a></h1><div class=post-meta><span class=post-date>March 26, 2018</span></div><span class=post-tags>#<a href=/tags/haskell/>Haskell</a>&nbsp;</span><div class=post-content>Preface lens are one of the most popular, yet confusing aspect of Haskell.

We shall try to look at brief definitions for the scope of this article.
Functor According to Haskell docs, a functor is simply something that can be mapped over.
In other words, it is an abstraction for a context with the ability to apply a function to all the things inside the context. The context can be defined as container, computation etc.</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/posts/applicative-functors/>Read more →</a></div></div><div class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=/posts/lazy-seq/>lazy-seq - Lazy Sequences in Clojure</a></h1><div class=post-meta><span class=post-date>January 10, 2018</span></div><span class=post-tags>#<a href=/tags/clojure/>Clojure</a>&nbsp;</span><div class=post-content>lazy-seq - How?

So how can Clojure be used to build stateful applications? That’s where Atom enter the picture.
In simple words, atom in Clojure is a built-in mechanism to manage application state. Atoms are mutable, and can be updated as many times as you want.
Let’s look at a practical example to understand the usage and implications of atom . We begin by looking up the documentation of atom in repl.</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/posts/atoms/>Read more →</a></div></div><div class=pagination><div class=pagination__buttons></div></div></div></div><footer class=footer><div class=footer__inner><div class="copyright copyright--user"><span>Blog by Namrata Chaudhary :: Powered by Hugo :: Theme made by [panr](https://twitter.com/panr)</span></div></div></footer><script src=/assets/main.js></script><script src=/assets/prism.js></script></div></body></html>
