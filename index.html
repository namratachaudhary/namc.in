Creating a very basic and bare-minimum observable infrastructure Considering that the system engineer is somewhat well-versed with cloud-friendly observability tools, let’s look at some tools that can help lay-down a sound foundation for system observability</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/posts/cloud-observability-ii/>Read more →</a></div></div><div class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=/posts/cloud-observability/>Understanding Observability (and the family) in Cloud Infrastructure</a></h1><div class=post-meta><span class=post-date>May 11, 2020</span></div><span class=post-tags>#<a href=/tags/devops/>Devops</a>&nbsp;</span><div class=post-content>This blog post is divided in two parts -

While we learn a lot about making highly available systems, we often overlook resiliency in system design.
Sure we have heard about fault-tolerant, but what is “resilience” now? Personally, I like to define it a system’s ability to handle and eventually recover from unexpected conditions. There are several ways to go about making your systems resilient to failure, but in this post, we will focus on following</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/posts/retries-timeouts-backoff/>Read more →</a></div></div><div class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=/posts/ssh-port-forwarding/>SSH Tunneling - Local, Remote & Dynamic</a></h1><div class=post-meta><span class=post-date>June 26, 2018</span></div><span class=post-tags>#<a href=/tags/networking/>Networking</a>&nbsp;</span><div class=post-content>Most of us are familiar with SSH (Secure Shell) - a protocol which allows us to securely log onto remote systems. SSH Tunneling (also known as SSH Port Forwarding) is a feature of SSH which forwards encrypted connections between a local and remote system. SSH tunneling works by using the already established SSH connection for sending additional network traffic.
We’re going to look at the three types of port forwarding - local, remote & dynamic.</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/posts/ssh-port-forwarding/>Read more →</a></div></div><div class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=/posts/lenses-part-1/>Haskell Lens - Part 1</a></h1><div class=post-meta><span class=post-date>March 26, 2018</span></div><span class=post-tags>#<a href=/tags/haskell/>Haskell</a>&nbsp;</span><div class=post-content>Preface lens are one of the most popular, yet confusing aspect of Haskell.

Functor According to Haskell docs, a functor is simply something that can be mapped over.
In other words, it is an abstraction for a context with the ability to apply a function to all the things inside the context.
